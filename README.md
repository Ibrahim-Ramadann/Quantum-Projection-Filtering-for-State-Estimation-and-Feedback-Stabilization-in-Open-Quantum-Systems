# Quantum-Projection-Filtering-for-State-Estimation-and-Feedback-Stabilization-in-Open-Quantum-Systems
We examine an open quantum system that is subject to indirect and imperfect measurements. Specifically, for quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements, we show that the evolution of the system is confined to a properly selected manifold. This allows us to express the exact solution of the quantum filter equation in terms of a lower-dimensional stochastic differential equation, significantly reducing the computational complexity. Motivated by a quantum state reduction result for the predicted dynamics under QND measurement, we propose, in the case [H,L] ̸ = 0, a projection filter approach for the quantum state estimation.
